    <h3>⚠️ Planning Considerations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Avoided driving or parking in SF</li>
      <li>Navigated <strong>Pride Parade weekend</strong> closures and crowds</li>
      <li>Chose <strong>Asian lunch options</strong> after days of national park fast food</li>
      <li>Accounted for <strong>ride-hailing issues</strong> at major sightseeing spots</li>
    </ul>

<section class="trip-strategy">
  <h2 class="centered">🧠 Trip Design Strategy</h2>
  <p>With only one full day in San Francisco — and full road-trip days on either side — I planned this itinerary as a balance of <strong>efficiency and ease</strong>. The goal: a natural-feeling route anchored by standout experiences, without overwhelm.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Transit over traffic:</strong> Used Muni, buses, and Waymo to keep things stress-free and interesting.</li>
    <li><strong>Crowd-smart timing:</strong> Arrived early for the Pride Parade to enjoy the atmosphere, then slipped away before it got packed. Meals were planned before peak times to skip lines and noise.</li>
    <li><strong>Alternative icons:</strong> Swapped busy spots like Lombard Street for Grandview Park and the 16th Ave Tiled Steps.</li>
    <li><strong>Built-in breaks:</strong> Meals and photo stops doubled as rest moments — including a comfort-forward Asian lunch.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Every choice was intentional — designed to feel <em>effortless but memorable</em>. The kind of day you'd want when hosting family in a busy city.</p>
