    <h3>🎯 Trip Goals</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Combine <strong>city energy</strong> with <strong>cultural depth</strong> in a single, cohesive route</li>
        <li>Experience regional <strong>food variety</strong> as a core part of daily exploration</li>
        <li>Prioritize meaningful cultural access — temples, hot springs, and seasonal traditions</li>
        <li>Build a flexible yet recharging solo trip with smooth transitions and minimal stress</li>
        <li>Practice my <strong>Japanese</strong> skills through signage, menus, and casual interactions</li>
      </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="snapshot-column">
    <h3>⚠️ Planning Considerations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Japan’s <strong>New Year season</strong> brings closures, crowds, and strict reservation requirements — everything had to be booked well in advance</li>
      <li>Public transportation is reliable but <strong>complex</strong> — researched pass types, transfer rules, and station layouts to avoid confusion</li>
      <li>Used <strong>budget</strong>-friendly hostels in big cities to offset a splurge on the onsen ryokan experience</li>
      <li>Popular food spots often require reservations, even for solo diners — shaped both meal planning and pacing</li>
      <li>Limited time meant <strong>prioritizing</strong> depth over coverage — focused on Kansai before a short final stop in Tokyo</li>
    </ul>

<section class="trip-strategy">
  <h2 class="centered">🧠 Trip Design Strategy</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Focused the trip around Kansai:</strong> Osaka, Kobe, Arima Onsen, and Kyoto offered rich culture and food. Tokyo was added briefly for a better return flight.</li>
    <li><strong>Staggered reservation planning:</strong> Built a tracker to monitor booking windows. Scheduled high-demand meals and trains with flexible buffers.</li>
    <li><strong>Balanced sensory load:</strong> Alternated lively areas (like Dotonbori) with quiet mornings and scenic evenings to maintain energy.</li>
    <li><strong>Optional backups for extra energy:</strong> Kept a short list of nearby cafés, shops, and scenic spots to add in without disrupting flow.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Every choice was intentional — not overstuffed, not rushed, and always aligned with what I value most when designing travel: clarity, immersion, and ease.</p>
