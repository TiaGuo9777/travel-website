    <h3>⚠️ Planning Considerations</h3>

<section class="trip-strategy">
  <h2 class="centered">🧠 Trip Design Strategy</h2>
  <p>This two-day Arches itinerary was built around two key constraints: <strong>summer desert heat</strong> and <strong>Eastern Time remote work hours</strong>. Mornings were anchored by major hikes — The Windows Section and Delicate Arch — timed for the softest light and fewest crowds. Between late morning and evening, I stayed indoors for work and rest, with optional scenic stops researched in case of extra energy or favorable weather.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Sunrise strategy:</strong> Prioritized early hikes to beat the heat and crowds</li>
    <li><strong>Work integration:</strong> Midday downtime aligned with Eastern Time remote work hours</li>
    <li><strong>Evening flexibility:</strong> Built-in time for scenic drives or rest before sunset outings</li>
    <li><strong>Fresh finale:</strong> Added Canyonlands for variety and a no-repeat route</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Each moment was designed to feel <em>relaxed yet rewarding</em> — a steady rhythm of exploration, comfort, and awe.</p>
